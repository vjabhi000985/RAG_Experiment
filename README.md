# RAG_Experiment
Using LangChain framework, build a RAG system that can utilize the power of LLM like Gemini 1.5 Pro to answer questions on the “Leave No Context Behind” paper published by Google on 10th April 2024. In this process, external data(i.e. Leave No Context Behind Paper) should be retrieved and then passed to the LLM when doing the generation step.
